# Ron's Breakfast Finder - Group 1 Project 1

```AS A hungry MEATEATER, I want to find a place to eat. WHEN I look at the webpage, I am presented with the only two food groups that matter: breakfast and steak. So that I can satisfy my desire to consume an animal, I can then decide to search for a restaurant by putting in my city name or zip code and clicking search. I will then be presented with a list of restaurants. When I find one to my liking, I can click on the restaurant and then view their menu.  Once you click on a restaurant choice, you will also be entertained with a quote from yours truly, Ron Swanson.```
